\usage{
enrichEWAS(input, filename = "default", method = "GO", ont = "MF", pool = FALSE, filterP = "PVAL",
cutoff = 0.05, plot = TRUE, plotType = "dot", plotcolor = "pvalue", showCategory= NULL, pAdjustMethod = "BH",
qvalueCutoff = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{An R6 class integrated with all the information obtained from the startEWAS or plotEWAS
or bootEWAS function.}

\item{filename}{User-customized .xlsx file name for storing EWAS results. If
"default" is chosen, it will be named as "enrichresult".}

\item{method}{Methods of enrichment analysis, including "GO" and "KEGG".}

\item{filterP}{The name of the p value columns such as "PVAL", "FDR", and "Bonfferoni." Users use
this P-value to screen for significance sites and further conduct enrichment analysis.}

\item{cutoff}{The cutoff value of the P-value used to filter for further enrichment analysis.
The default is 0.05.}

\item{ont}{When choosing GO enrichment analysis, select the GO sub-ontology for which the enrichment analysis
will be performed. One of "BP", "MF", and "CC" sub-ontologies, or "ALL" for all three. Default to "BP".}

\item{pool}{If ont='ALL', whether pool 3 GO sub-ontologies.}

\item{plot}{Whether the results of enrichment analysis need to be visualized, the default is TRUE}

\item{plotType}{Whether to draw a bar plot ("bar") or a dot plot ("dot"), the default is "dot".}

\item{plotcolor}{It is the vertical axis of the picture of the enrichment analysis results. Users can choose
"pvalue" or "p.adjust" or "qvalue". The default is "pvalue".}

\item{showCategory}{The number of categories which will be displayed in the plots.}

\item{pvalueCutoff}{The p-value threshold used to filter enrichment results. Only results that pass
the p-value test (i.e., those smaller than this value) will be reported. This value refers to the
p-value before adjustment. The p-value represents the probability of observing the current level of enrichment
under the assumption of no enrichment. The smaller the p-value, the more significant the enrichment result.}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{The p-value adjustment method used for multiple hypothesis testing, aimed at reducing false
positives caused by multiple comparisons. One of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none".}

\item{qvalueCutoff}{qvalue cutoff on enrichment tests to report as significant. The q-value is the result
of controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and represents the proportion of false positives that
may occur when conducting multiple tests.Tests must pass i) pvalueCutoff on unadjusted pvalues, ii) pvalueCutoff
on adjusted pvalues and iii) qvalueCutoff on qvalues to be reported. The default is 0.2.}
