Description: easyEWAS is an R package designed for conducting Epigenome-Wide Association 
    Study (EWAS) and visualizing results. Users only need to provide sample data, and 
    methylation values to easily perform EWAS analysis. The package supports two statistical 
    methods,linear models and linear mixed-effects models. It utilizes the CMplot 
    package to generate visualizations, including Manhattan plots and QQ plots, 
    based on EWAS results. Additionally, the use of parallel computing significantly 
    improves computational efficiency, making it suitable for researchers less 
    experienced in EWAS or parallel computing.
